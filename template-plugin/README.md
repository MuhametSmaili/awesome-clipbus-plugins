# Template Plugin

*English · [中文](./README_zh.md)*

> Read [GUIDE.md](./GUIDE.md) before writing a new plugin. Together with this project, it is the complete starter kit for developing Clipbus plugins.

`template-plugin/` is a **minimal yet full-featured** template project for third-party plugin authors and AI assistants. It is written for plugin protocol V2 (manifest `schemaVersion` 5) and the SDK package `@clipbus/plugin-sdk` 1.x, and shows every extension point: detectors, card pages (renderers) and Actions, plus typed messages between a card page and the plugin runtime.

> **Install hook:** when the manifest declares `install`, Clipbus asks for confirmation before running it. Clipbus provides its verified npm command or CLI through `CLIPBUS_PLUGIN_NPM_PATH`: this template runs JavaScript CLI files with the current Node process and executes other host-provided npm executables or shims directly. It never falls back to an `npm` found on PATH. See [GUIDE.md](./GUIDE.md) for details.

## Must-read documents

| Document | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [GUIDE.md](./GUIDE.md) | Scaffold workflow: quick start, preview, debugging in Clipbus, build, verify, tests |
| `node_modules/@clipbus/plugin-sdk/docs/README.md` | Documentation map of the installed SDK: architecture, manifest, entry points, ctx, pitfalls |
| `node_modules/@clipbus/plugin-sdk/API.md` | Generated reference of every method, event, entry, type and limit |

> The SDK docs and `API.md` ship with the SDK package and always match the installed version. Refresh them with `npm update @clipbus/plugin-sdk`; never edit them by hand.

## How a V2 plugin is put together

| Part | Runs in | Written with | In this template |
|---|---|---|---|
| detector | plugin runtime (Node) | `definePlugin({ detectors })`; writes through `ctx.item.*`, returns nothing | `features/template-detector`, `capability-gallery/runtime/detector.ts` |
| card page (renderer) | WebView | `ctx` from `@clipbus/plugin-sdk/view`; no runtime entry | `features/*/app.vue` |
| Action | plugin runtime | `definePlugin({ actions })`; returns `result.text / image / none` | `features/auto-action`, `capability-gallery/runtime/actions.ts` |
| message | plugin runtime | `defineMessage<Req, Resp>(name)`: the page calls `.call(data)`, the runtime registers `.handle(fn)` | `features/expanded-renderer/messages.ts`, `capability-gallery/contracts.ts` |

Contracts that both sides use — attachment payload types (`defineAttachment<T>`) and messages (`defineMessage<Req, Resp>`) — come from the root entry `@clipbus/plugin-sdk` and live in files the runtime and the pages both import (`payload.ts`, `messages.ts`, `contracts.ts`). Node-only code (file access, hashing) stays in runtime files.

Inside the Clipbus monorepo the project also carries `scripts/export.mjs`, `tests/export.test.cjs` and `tests/integration/bridge.test.cjs` (the built runtime in the Node bridge the Hosts embed). They are monorepo-only and are left out of the standalone template.

## Capabilities demonstrated

### detector — `template-detector`

- File: `src/features/template-detector/detector.ts`; `inputKinds`: `text`, `image`
- Writes through `ctx`: the preview attachment with a card title (`Text · 3 lines`), the expanded attachment, a search extension entry, and a `json` tag on text that parses as JSON. The handler returns nothing.
- When it returns, the Host replaces this detector's previous output with what the run wrote, and skips writes equal to what is stored. A run that writes nothing clears its output.
- Detection runs after every copy. `trigger` tells why: `copy`, `recopy` (Core matched an existing item), `edit` or `manual`. On `recopy` the detector reuses its stored output instead of hashing the content again.
- Image items carry metadata only; the detector reads the file through `ctx.input.imagePath()`.

### card page, fixed height — `template-renderer`

- Files: `src/features/preview-renderer/{payload.ts,app.vue}`; manifest `height: { min: 220, max: 220 }`, `tint`, two default `buttons`
- `useCard(previewAttachment)` reads the startup snapshot (`ctx.renderer.context`) and follows `item.changed` / `env.changed`; the buttons arrive through `ctx.renderer.onButton` and copy with `ctx.system.copyText`.
- The card title comes from the attachment card the detector wrote; it overrides the manifest title.
- **Convention:** pages do not draw the outer background, border, radius or shadow; the Host and the preview draw the card shell. Theme tokens are also available as `--clipbus-*` CSS variables.

### card page, adaptive height — `template-expanded-renderer`

- Files: `src/features/expanded-renderer/{payload.ts,messages.ts,analyze.ts,app.vue}`; manifest `height: { min: 120, max: 480 }`
- `autoFit()` from `@clipbus/plugin-sdk/dom` measures the content and calls `ctx.renderer.update({ height })`; the Host keeps the height in the manifest range.
- **Analyze** sends the typed message `analyzeItem.call()`; the runtime handler reads the full content (`ctx.item.getContent()`, `ctx.input.imagePath()`) and answers.
- The accent strip follows the `accent` theme token through `env.changed`.

### Actions — `src/features/auto-action/action.ts`

- `template-auto-action` (text, image), `-text`, `-image`: describe the input as a `result.text(...)`. `item` is the item the Flow started from; `content` is the current cascaded value. The image variant reads the file through `ctx.input.imagePath()`.
- With the gallery Actions the manifest declares 6 Actions and 5 renderers, above the free-tier quotas (3 each), so a free-tier Host shows the Plugin Pro gating.

### capability-gallery

- Directory: `src/features/capability-gallery/` — see its [README](./src/features/capability-gallery/README.md) for the capability matrix.
- 1 detector (three cards) + 3 Actions (one per result kind) + 3 card pages (fixed, auto, bounded) + 3 messages.
- The bounded page calls every page-side method and shows every Host event; its runtime probes run the runtime-side methods inside a message call. Node-drawn images are written to `cache/…` and shown with `ctx.asset.fileUrl(path)`.

## Getting-started checklist

Change these first so the manifest and the code stay in step:

1. `manifest.json` — `plugin.id`, titles, `renderers[].attachmentType` (must start with `<plugin.id>.`), `page`, `height`, `tint`, `buttons`, `inputKinds`, and `writes` (every attachment type and search scope the plugin writes)
2. `src/plugin.ts` — detector and Action keys must equal the manifest ids
3. `src/features/<feature>/payload.ts` / `messages.ts` — attachment and message contracts shared by runtime and page
4. detector / Action / message handlers — runtime code
5. `src/features/<feature>/{app.vue,main.ts,index.html}` — the card page, plus its line in `PAGE_SOURCES` in `scripts/build-ui.mjs`
6. `src/preview/scenarios/` — preview scenarios for the new cards

Usually **no need to change**: `src/shared/`, `scripts/install.mjs`, `scripts/build-runtime.mjs`, `scripts/verify-build.mjs`.

## Common commands

```sh
npm install       # install dependencies (including @clipbus/plugin-sdk)
npm run dev       # preview workbench for the card pages (@clipbus/plugin-sdk/preview)
npm run build     # typecheck + lint + build to dist/ + verify the build
npm test          # tests/**/*.test.cjs against the built dist/
npm run verify    # manifest validation, build, runtime manifest validation, then tests
```
